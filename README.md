# Melee_Fighter

Developed with Unreal Engine 5


Personal project to learn and get comfortable in unreal engine. Goal is to make a melee sword combat game that has enemies, impliments a health, stamina, and mana system, and a dodging and blocking/parrying mechanic. If this is well written, it may serves as the basis for more ambitious projects in the future.
